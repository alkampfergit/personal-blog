Semantic Kernel reached Release Candidate and there are some breaking changes from the latest beta. For this reason I re-recorded a series of video I've planned a couple of week ago with all examples updated to RC3.

Here is the list on my youtube channel: [Semantic Kernel Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn9t_BnhwY0Ic-0IdTAaQNEwoIdNveYHy)

- [Call python function from C#](https://youtu.be/ZyMnw3ryJJ0) - How you can call python code from C# to simplify interaction with LLM or other Models
- [Using new Handlebar templates](https://youtu.be/n8In5rrrodA) - How to interact with a LLM (GPT in this example) with classic chat mode
- [Create plugins in C#](https://youtu.be/exu7i8qXkW0) - How to Create plugin in C# and call directly through kernel object 
- [AutoPluginInvoker capabilities](https://youtu.be/Vc8dtwxcXbI) - Let Semantic Kernel automatically invoke plugin if needed during your chat interaction with GPT

All the videos are in my youtube channel.
