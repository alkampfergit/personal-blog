[Professional Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio 2013](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118836588.html)  **covers all aspects and tools of Microsoft ALM Ecosystem** , giving you all the details on how to implement effectively ALM for your team/s. This book is dedicated to all people involved in a Software Project, from managers who plan work with new Portfolio Management features, to developers that create the product, and finally to testers and end users that could monitor quality with Microsoft Test Manager and Feedback Tool. Everything is explained clearly and with full details, making this book a perfect companion for everyday work.

Even you own previous editions, I strongly suggest you to buy this new one, because **it covers all the new feature of TFS 2013**. This new edition contains some brand news chapters to understand what Git offers as an alternative to TFVC for source control, as well as showing how to do Enterprise Agile with Portfolio Management or using Release management to deploy applications in production environments with a controlled and repeatable process.

Due to redesign of Team Explorer in Visual Studio 2013 and some other changes to existing features, all content of previous editions was updated and revamped to reflect latest bit of Visual Studio ALM 2013 Family.

If you use TFS or VSO is time to update your bookshelf.
