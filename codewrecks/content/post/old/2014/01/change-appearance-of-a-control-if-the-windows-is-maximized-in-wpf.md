Yesterday I was presented with an interesting question:

*How can I design a user control that change appearance when the windows containing it is maximized?*

Thanks to WPF binding and Triggers the solution is simple, suppose you want to  **create a border control that change thickness when the windows that contains this User Control is maximized** , here is the code.

{{< highlight xml "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}


 <Border BorderBrush="Black"
                HorizontalAlignment="Left" 
                Height="100" 
                Margin="124,54,0,0" 
                VerticalAlignment="Top"
                Width="100">
            <Border.Style>
                <Style TargetType="Border">
                    <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="1" />
                    <Style.Triggers>
                        <DataTrigger Binding="{Binding 
                                RelativeSource={RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type Window}}, 
                                Path=WindowState}" 
                              Value="Maximized">
                            <Setter Property="BorderThickness" Value="10" />
                        </DataTrigger>
                    </Style.Triggers>
                </Style>
            </Border.Style>
        </Border>

{{< / highlight >}}

The solution is using a simple style that determines the value for the BorderThickness property of the Border Control. The key part is that  **I did not set an explicit value for BorderThickness in declaration of the control, but only in the style.** This is necessary because value set at control level has higher priority than the style. The real power of WPF binding permits you to  **bind to RelativeSource with FindAncestor where Type is a Window**. That specific binding is really useful in a UserControl, because you cannot know any property name of containers, but it **is easy to find the first ancestor of type Window**. Then you can simply create the trigger with this specific binding and change the property BorderThickness of the Border to 10 when the windows containing the user control gets maximized.
