If you needs to manage some RSS content in your asp.net application maybe[RSS Toolkit](http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/archive/2006/03/26/561200.aspx) is the answer to all of your problems. In [this post](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/02/22/438738.aspx) of Scott Guthrie there is also a good tutorial on the toolkit, it is worth to take a look.
