Today is not a good day for a couple of reasons, but now my visual studio instance begins to behave in a strange manner, when I digit ALT+126 to make tilde character in a code windows, a strange chars appears instead of tilde, and the font of the visual studio changes, here how it looks like on my monitor

In every other window ALT+126 works as expected (~), mahâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦

Alk.
