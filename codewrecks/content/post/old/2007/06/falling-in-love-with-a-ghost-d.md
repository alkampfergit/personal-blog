After a long time that some friends told me about boo language, finally yesterday I downloaded the trunk and began to familiarize with the language. The first thing that surprised me is the ability to break into debugger with simple instruction like these

import System.Diagnostics

Debug.Fail(“”)

And your favorite debugger will show up with full support for intellisense, step and so on, I’m very pleased with this.

Alk.
