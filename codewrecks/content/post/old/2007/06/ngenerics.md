If you like me are tired of.NET standard IList&lt;T&gt; that does not offer a lot of method to do sorting, filtering and more, you can have a look at [NGenerics](http://www.codeplex.com/NGenerics/), a complete library composed of a lot of classes to satisfy all the need you can have to store data. You have algorithms for Graph for math, data structures and a lot more. What I really love are the classes for sorting, ranging from bubblesort, quicksort and a lot more.
