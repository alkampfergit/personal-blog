I want to signal you this project on codeplex ([http://tfscollab.codeplex.com/](http://tfscollab.codeplex.com/ "http://tfscollab.codeplex.com/")) that contains some provider to enable collaboration with Team foundation Server power tools.

I’m expecially a fan of the Skype integration ([http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/01/14/skype-and-the-new-team-explorer.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/01/14/skype-and-the-new-team-explorer.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/01/14/skype-and-the-new-team-explorer.aspx")) and if you use skype and TFS I strongly suggest you to give a look at that project.
