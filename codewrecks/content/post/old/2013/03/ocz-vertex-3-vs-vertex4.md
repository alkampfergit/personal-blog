I own both a Vertex3 256GB and a Vertex 4 256, and people usually ask me if the vertex 4 is really faster than vertex 3, or difference in performance are really little. I think it is difficult to answer this question, I can only post you Cristal Diskmark test for both drive when they are completely empty.

This is the Vertex 3

And this is the Vertex 4

From the test I can tell you that the Vertex 4 has a  **great increase of performance in Write Speed** , and a real gain of performance in 4K QD32 tests. I had also a Vertex 2 and I was really satisfied with performance and reliability of OCZ drive, and I should admit that the Vertex 4 performances are really really huge.

Do not forget that such a drive needs a good Sata controller or you can suffer performance loss, as [I described in an old post.](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2012/02/25/pay-attention-where-you-attach-your-ssd-driver/)

If you work heavily with Visual Studio or you run quite often Virtual Machines, having a fast SSD is a must.
