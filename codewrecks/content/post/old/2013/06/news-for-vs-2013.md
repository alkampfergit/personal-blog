With the new release cadence, *Brian Harry announced at TechEd a lot of news on the upcoming version of Visual Studio* and you can read everything directly on Brian Harry’s post [Visual Studio 2013](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/06/03/visual-studio-2013.aspx). The cool part is that some of these new features are already available on TF Service and we can start using right now.

You can read about those **new features directly from the TF Service News blog, on** [**Team Foundation Service Updates for Tech Ed 2013**](http://tfs.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2013-jun-3), and clearly you can start using immediately.

Happy TFS.
