I’ve just seen this [interesting video of Dan Bergh Johnsson on DDD Security](http://dddcommunity.org/dan_bergh_johnsson_daniel_gackle_2013) and I must admit that I agree with Dan under many aspect. One of the real advantage of DDD is making business explicit, and this can help in so many places in your software, that [even security can benefit of DDD](http://dddcommunity.org/dan_bergh_johnsson_daniel_gackle_2013). It is a video I suggest you to watch, because is really small and it can open up a lot of discussion on  **Value Objects** , one of the most useful pattern when you work with DDD.
