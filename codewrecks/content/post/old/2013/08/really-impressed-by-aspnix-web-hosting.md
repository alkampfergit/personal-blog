I needed to move my blog on another hosting quickly, and I was puzzled on what hosting to choose. Since I had no much time to evaluate a series of alternative, I asked to some friends for an  **hosting that have monthly billing and they directed me towards** [**aspnix**](https://aspnix.com/). Since I had no time to evaluate alternatives my plan was to move the blog on a cheap monthly plan then evaluate alternatives. I choose  the [Windows Starter Web Hosting](https://aspnix.com/web-hosting/windows-starter-hosting/), it costs $3.00 at each month but I had also a discount coupon so I paid $2.20 for each month.

Since the host was really really cheap and it is a shared hosting, I expected performances to degrade, but I was really surprised that my blog responded really fast, it seemed faster than previous hosting (a dedicated VM). After one month I was really surprised looking at Google Webmaster tools, because  **the decrease in response time was really huge and not only my impression**.

You can surely notice that the time needed to download a page decreased when I moved to aspnix. I’m so happy with it that I’ve decided not to spent time evaluating anything else, and for $2.20 month I can host multiple domains, amazing. I never expected that a cheap and shared hosting would give me better performance than a dedicated VM.

I must admit that AspNix really Rocks!!!!!
