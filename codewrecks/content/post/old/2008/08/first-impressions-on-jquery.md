I’ve finished reading the second chapter of “Jquery In Action” and I must admit that seems to me a very interesting library.

JQuery permits you to select various part of the DOM with a great flexibility, and I think that it can really simplify writing client code even for ASP.NEt application, where selecting the element by id is usually not so immediate, because ASP.NET generate the id of the HTML elements composing their id with those of their containers, generating the well known container$container$controlid pattern.

with JQuery selecting a series of elements is done with a special selector sintax, so you can write $(“p a”) to select all link inside a &lt;P&gt; tag, and you have really a lot of possibilities, because JQuery has a really a lot of selecting operator.

I think that it is a library that worth take a look at.

alk.
