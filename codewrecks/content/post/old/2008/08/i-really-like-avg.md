Some days ago I [posted](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2008/07/22/windows-live-messenger-error-81000395/) about a problem with avg 8.0 that makes me impossible to login in Windows Live Messenger. The great number of comments to that post showed me that a really great number of people suffered the same problem.

Today I reactivated AVG MSN protection, and now everything works fine. It seems that AVG corrected the problem.

I really like AVG, I used it for the past 5 years and it seems a very good product.

Alk.
