It seems absurd, but I made a simple test to verify if my smtp server is working, I sent to one of my address one mail with subject “test” and body “test”. Then after 1 minutes the mail still did not arrived, so I deduced that my smtp server is not working properly….then…I goes into the junk mail folder of outlook and I found that my mail was flagged as spam :D, I do not know the reason, but I suppose that outlook is smart enough to consider all your addresses as trusted ones :D

alk.
