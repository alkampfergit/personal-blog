I forget to welcome [guardian’s home](http://www.nablasoft.com/guardian) the new blog of another nablasoft member. After long time it seems that he now realized that blogging is a real interesting activity to do.

Since He is a better graphic designer than me (I think I can tell the same of everyone, I’m a really poor graphic designer) he spent some time to improve the look of the site….it reminds me that I really need to improve the layout of my blog.

Now I need to remind him to publish stuffs…he really have a lot of interesting code to show, [but he’s too lazy :D](http://www.nablasoft.com/guardian/index.php/2008/08/06/back-to-action/) as he admit in his first post.

Alk.
