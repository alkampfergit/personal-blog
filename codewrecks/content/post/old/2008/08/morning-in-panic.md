This morning I upgraded my wordpress blog from 2.5 to 2.6, I made backup, then installed new files, but when I upgraded my database the routine gives me some errors…

After a brief look I found a post that shows that my error happened to some other people, but is not blocking one, and it can be ignored…except that all my permalinks are broken…… time to panic alk….

I restored everything…now all the page returned blank page…… panic level is reaching maximum level alk….

then fortunately my friend [guardian](http://www.nablasoft.com/guardian/) gives me [this link](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/189058) and it seems that everyting is now ok….

I still wonder why backup did not work………..

alk.
