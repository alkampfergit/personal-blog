Some days ago I was cleaning stuffs from my HD, just to regain space. I found that a lot of space is occupied by old virtual disc of my old virtual machines (vmware). I decided that there is no need to keep these machine again, since now I have newer VM with windows server 2008, and because I use VM primarly to try some software not to make my principal installation dirty.

After some days I discovered that in these VM I did some try with a particular sdk…since I deleted all virtual disk of the machine…..that work is gone. Nothing so important, but it is a waste of time for me to rewrite that code (a couple of hours)

I always remember that I pay a lot of attention when I delete the old stuff. Everything that could be interesting  should go into a subversion, so I never lost anything.

Alk.
