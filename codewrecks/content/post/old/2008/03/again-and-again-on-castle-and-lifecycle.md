You can find at this subversion repository ( [http://nablasoft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Castle/TestIOC](http://nablasoft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Castle/TestIOC "http://nablasoft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Castle/TestIOC") ) a simple project that contains a custom lifecycle that bound the lifecycle of objects to a  context. This lifecycle was created to address the problem of disposing inner object, [you can find the deails here](http://www.nablasoft.com/Alkampfer/?p=156). This new version support both singleton and transient objects, this a sample test.

This test shows that an object with singletonContext custom lifecycle is singleton inside a context, and when the context ends all it gets disposed and all the inner references are disposed too. This lifecycle has the main purpose of estabilishing a context that once ended dispose every object created inside the context itself.

The code is still experimental, but it can be a viable solution.
