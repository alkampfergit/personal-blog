Implementing IQueryable is not a joke, [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar/archive/2007/10/09/linq-building-an-iqueryable-provider-part-ix.aspx) there is an excellent tutorial. I’m actually playing on Linq2Nhibernate by ayende and I realize that traversing an Expression Tree is not so painful, but surely complicated.
