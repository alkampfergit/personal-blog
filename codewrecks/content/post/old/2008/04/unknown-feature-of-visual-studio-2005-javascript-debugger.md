One of my friends told me that one of the most interesting news of Visual studio 2008 is the ability to debug javascript ….. but this is possible even with visual studio 2005.

Just try to write the line

*debugger;*

into javascript code and when you run the page you are prompted to attach a debugger, just attach the visual studio with the solution open and the game is done ;). Do not forget to keep open the *script explorer*windows, you can find it in Debug-&gt;Windows-&gt;Script Explorer, this windows gives you a list of all the script loaded into Internet Explorer and you can use to put breakpoint into.

Alk.
