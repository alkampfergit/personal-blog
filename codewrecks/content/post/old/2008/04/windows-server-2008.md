Today I installed windows server 2008 into VmWare Server. I must admit that VmWare server is fantastic, the system goes smooth, it seems to work on a real machine and not on a windows server.

The only thing that does not work is the aero desktop, probably because the SVGA video emulation does not support 3D function to support aero.

Alk.
