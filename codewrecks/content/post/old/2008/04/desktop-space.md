I was always astonished when I think to the evolution of pc. I’m 34 years old and my first pc was a 8086 with a 13” monitor with a resolution of 640×480=307.200 pixel.

Then I moved to a 14” monitor and I used to work mainly at 800×600 = 480.000 pixel, so I have 56% more space on screen.

After a quite long time I moved to 17”, and switched to 1024×768 = 786.432 pixel, and I have another 63% more space on screen.

Then my first lcd comes, it is a 17” but the resolution is 1280×1024 = 1.310.720 pixel, another 66% more space on screen.

When I realized that more space you have on your desktop, more productive you are, I decided to buy another 17” and use two monitor system. At That time I have two 1280×1024 desktop = 2.621.440 pixel, and obviously a 100% improve respect the previous configuration.

Then I begin to work on laptop, it has a wide 15” screen, and has a resolution of 1280×800, I obviously use one of my 17” monitor as secondary monitor, but the overall space on my desktop was decreased……so I decided to make the big jump, and I bought a 24” monitor with a resolution of 1920×1200+ 1280×800 = 3.328.000 pixels, another 26% space more respect my two 17” configuration.

Now I come back to work on desktop, so I mount two video board, and use all my three monitor for a total resolution of 1920×1200 + 2 \* (1280 \* 1024) = 4.925.440 that is another 48% improve and a 1600% improve respect my first 800×600 configuration :D :D :D.

It is incredible how the technology was improved in the last years, when the first lcd monitor came on market, it cost a lot of money, it was a 15” and it took about a couple of years to see the first 17” lcd, then after a brief time it cames 19” then 21” 22” 24”, and the time to see new size on the market is greatly reduced.

I wander on how my computer will be 10 years in the future :D

Alk.
