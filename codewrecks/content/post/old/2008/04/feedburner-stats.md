This morning I had a great surprise, I saw in feedburner 103 readers of my blog, it is really great for me to reach three digit count :D, it means that my blog interests some people. 103 is not such a great number, but thinking that in the world 100 person are interested in what I’m saying is really exiting. Hope to raise this stat in the future, thanks to everyone, have a great day.
