I’m a really bad graphics designer, but the old skin I used for my blog is really old, and does not fit well with wordpress 2.6, so I take an already existing theme, and modified it to make it similar to the old skin.

I won’t tell you issue I had writing php code, fortunately I needed only to change a little bit here and there, I create some icons with axialis icon worshop and here my new skin is online.

I do not like it very more, maybe in the next days I’ll give it a better look.

alk.
