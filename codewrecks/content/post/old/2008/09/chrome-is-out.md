I’m installing google [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), the new browser from Google. I suspect that it will not became my favourite browser in the near future, I use a lot of addins for Firefox and I’m very satisfied with it, so I does not feel the need for another browser.

Probably Chrome will rapidly become one of the most used browser, so we’ll see in the future how this will change the web. For web developers it will be another browser were we need to test our applications, but maybe it will really simplify writing [RIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application) and will bring a new generation of application to the web.

Only time will tell :D
