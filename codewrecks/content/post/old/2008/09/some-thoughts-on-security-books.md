I’m not a security expert and I have a basic knowledge of the subject, such as knowing STRIDE, a little bit of SDL and some background on cryptography. If I look at my bookshelf I see that I have some security books on various argument, and I’m wonder if they are enough or if I need to buy some other books.

There are a lot of good books on security but I think that the argument deserves some special treatment. What I mean is that “ **We does not need more security books but more security in each Book** “. For some technologies like asp.net there are great books of more than 1000 pages, that contains little or no information about security issues. You can buy [some](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Microsoft-ASP-NET-Applications-Pro-Developer/dp/0735618909/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1221134899&amp;sr=8-3) [other](http://www.amazon.com/Secure-ASP-NET-AJAX-Development/dp/B000OZ0NLW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1221134899&amp;sr=8-2) [books](http://www.amazon.com/Developing-More-Secure-Microsoft%C2%AE-Applications-Developer/dp/0735623317/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1221134899&amp;sr=8-1) on the subject, but in the end developers tend to ignore security aspects of technologies.

It would be really better if all books on computer technologies devotes about 10% of the content to security issues, instead to force people to buy specific book on the argument. Security is an extremely important thing, and I cannot believe that a 1200 pages book on asp.net does not have enough room for two or three chapters dedicated to it.
