The [DotNetKicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/) community is really new for me, But I decided to try to contribute, and I found a really interesting plugin for Windows Live Writer [here](http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/2007/10/21/dotnetkicks-kick-it-counter-plugin-for-windows-live-writer/). I’ve installed also the WordPress related plugin, so let’s see if all works.
