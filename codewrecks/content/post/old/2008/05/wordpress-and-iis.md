When the last year I setup this blog I choose wordpress because It is the most common blog on the net, I told myself, “lets try, and see how it works”.

I think that wordpress is a really good blog engine, but my hosting use IIS…and this makes me not possible to enable Permalink. I’ve check some solutions on the web, but none of them worked.

This makes me reflect on how the Internet is a real complex environment to live in, many hosting, many technologies and many different problem. You choose a blog engine but then you can face problem with the hosting. There are a lot of hosting around here but the best solution is to have a dedicated server or some form of virtual server where you have full control of the system. Then you have Technorati, DotNetKick, communities, you are not able to follow everything…..

but it’s an immense virtual world where to live in, and it is good this way!!!! ;)
