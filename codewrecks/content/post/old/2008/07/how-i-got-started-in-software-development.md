Ok, my friend [Marco](http://codemetropolis.com) [tagged me](http://codemetropolis.com/archive/2008/07/14/how-i-got-started-in-software-development.aspx) and I cannot escape from doing this post :D.

 **How old were you when you started programming?** I do not remember exactly, It was Vic20 and it was early 80. I really loved basic at these times :D.

 **How did you get started in programming?** I simply turned on Vic 20, ran some games loaded from tape (yuck……it seems strange for me that music tape could contain games :D ) and then I began to read manuals..I found that I can program the computer, not only play with it, it was so exiting that I begin to study basic. When I grew older I decided that programming is really a funny thing, so it would be beautiful to make it my primary profession…..here I am :D

 **What was your first language?** Basic, like most people that started to play programming in the early ’80.

 **What was the first real program you wrote?** My first real program that did some real thing was a kind of “marrying agency” I wrote while I was a student. The program was written in turbo pascal 4.0, you entered some information about you (birthdate, things you like etc), the program save these information on disk (No RDBMS, just a custom record structure) and then try to find a match with other people in database, looking for astrological affinity, interest affinity…it was a really funny thing, because the first run was done with all my school friends :D.

The first program I did for profession was during university, written in Visual Basic 6, It was a tool to manage data for some historical buildings, I need to store information, images, and produce a txt file with weird format, that has to be sent to a national central database :D.

 **What languages have you used since you started programming?** I started with Basic, then turbo pascal, fortran and a little bit of Cobol. Last year of high school I played with prolog then shift to C/C++ and assembly language (Mainly x86 family and some specific architecture like Playstation2 and some MIPS, then Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0, and finally.NET environment (MSIL, Visual Basic.NET, c# and a little bit of Boo). When I was at university I used VHDL to create a simulation of a vertex and pixel shader).

 **What was your first professional programming gig?** When I was at university I begin a collaboration with an engineer that committed to our group some programs, we worked mainly on software for engineering companies.

 **If you knew then what you know now, would you have started programming?** Absolutely :D, I really like this work, maybe I would have choose different area, like videgames or 3d computer graphics.

 **If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?** Always strive yourself to learn something new, never stop to read articles, books, blogs, etc. Think that code you wrote yesterday could be written better tomorrow.

 **What’s the most fun you’ve ever had … programming?** It is difficult to answer, maybe Seeing the first textured cube on playstation2, I can rotate with controller, it was really a good sensation. Another interesting thing was fotogrammetry, we worked a lot of time ago on a custom algorithm, it was really a great sensation to scan two picture and see our program that draw the wireframe of the box to the screen. Then I really love community, making presentation, and sharing knowledge with other.

Who do I tag?

mmmmmmmm I can tag [Stefano Ottaviani](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/ste8/Default.aspx), a friend of DotnetMarche…hey ste….it is your turn :D
