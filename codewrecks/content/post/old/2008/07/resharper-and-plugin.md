Version 4.0 of [resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com) offers the ability to create [plugins](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/plugins/). This is very important, because you can use the basic structure of resharper to offer additional features. One of the most interesting, in my opinion, is the NHibernate plugin, I suggest you to have a try of it, another good reason to use resharper ;).
