This rtf generator is one of my first projects in.net, it started in Visual studio 2002 :D, then it was converted to visual studio 2003 and.net 1.1. Some time ago one of the developer of my team ask me if I know a quick way to generate an rtf file from asp.net, so I simply say

“Hey, I have this really old library of mine…..you can try at your own risk :D”

It seems to be enough for the needs of my friend, and so I decided to make it public with a BSD license. Please do not blame me for the code, I was young :D. The important stuff is that It seems to work (:D :D :D), or at least it worked on my machine in the 2003 …….
