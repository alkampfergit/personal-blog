Today I discovered [http://www.says-it.com/](http://www.says-it.com/ "http://www.says-it.com/") it is really a funny site. Actually I’m making silly thing :D but I created this logo

[![refactor](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/refactor-thumb.gif)](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/refactor.gif)

And the thing I miss most is that I cannot include in source code :(. It would be funny if visual studio make it possible to include images in source code and show them directly in the IDE. Sometimes I found in project code that really needs to be refactored, usually I setup a comment in the class and then issue a bug in the bug tracker…but having such a logo at the beginning of file would be really better :D

alk.
