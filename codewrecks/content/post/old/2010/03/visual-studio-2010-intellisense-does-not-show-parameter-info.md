I installed on metal VS2010 RC, and when I tried to write the first line of code I see that intellisense failed to show parameter info.

This bring me back when I was young, and we have to remember all C stdlib functions because we used vi in linux to edit source file, but in 2010 Iâ€™m really bad without intellisense.

Ok, I remember very well that SqlConnection has 2 constructors, but for complex classes working without intellisense can be a pain. Since all other functions of Intellisense work as expected I go to Tools/options menu and check the â€œText Editorâ€ / â€œAllLanguagesâ€ setting, and I found this

For some strange reason, in C# this option is disabled, so I simply re-enable for all languages, now everything works as expected.
