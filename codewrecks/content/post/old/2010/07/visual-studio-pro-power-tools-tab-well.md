One of the most exiting addin for VS2010 is the [Visual Studio 2010 Pro Power Tools](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef) that has a great number of features, but the most interesting one is the Document well, you can [read everything about it in this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2010/06/10/document-well-2010-plus.aspx).

This really boost productivity for those one having wide monitor, such as 24'' that has a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels, because I really loved the ability to use vertical document well, with project colored tab. I can immediately visualize the file by project with different color, and visualize a large number of opened files, instead of having them showed in the top, where very few of them are visible.
