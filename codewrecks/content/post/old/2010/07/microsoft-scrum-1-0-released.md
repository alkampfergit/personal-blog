Microsoft have just released the 1.0 version of the [scrum template for TFS](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/aaronbjork/archive/2010/07/19/announcing-microsoft-visual-studio-scrum-1-0.aspx). The reason behind this, is that a lot of person wish a template that closely match the scrum process, as described in the literature.

With this template we now have two agile process template, the first is the classic MSF Agile 5.0, that is based on scrum, but is more generic and is not strictly based on a Scrum process, and the new Scrum template to satisfy those one that want to implement a full feature Scrum process.

Go and take a look at it.

alk.
