NHQueryAnalyzer is a tool originally [written by Ayende](http://www.ayende.com/projects/nhibernate-query-analyzer.aspx), and now it is supported at [this link](http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/NHibernateQueryAnalyzer). I think that it is really a good tool, very useful even to learn HQL query because gives you an immediate idea of what the query will looks like. Here is a screenshot. (‘I've hide some sensitive part because this is part of a project of a [company](http://www.actvalue.com/) I worked with).

Query parsing is instantaneous, so you can immediately understand if your query is good or wrong.

You can also press F5 to execute the query to the database and take a look at returned object.

If you are a NHibernate user and you use HQL, you should not miss this tool.
