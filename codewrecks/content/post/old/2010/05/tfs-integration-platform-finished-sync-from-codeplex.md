Some [days ago](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2010/03/19/tfs-integration-platform-to-synchronize-from-codeplex-to-tfs2010/) I tried [TFS Integration Platform](http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/) to sync a project ([Dexter](http://dexterblogengine.codeplex.com/)) from codeplex to a local test TFS with Lab Management capabilities enabled. At that time the sync process did not work very well, the server take a long time before raising an exception and I did not have time to investigate further.

Yesterday I downloaded the latest version, dated 24 April, and try again the sync process. The most interesting stuff is that I was able to open the old project, and start again from the point it was stopped last time, cool. After an hour here is the result.

It finished and it is Green, finally, now I moved to the TFS to see what is happened.

Checkins are there, and clearly, they are numbered differently from the original codeplex tfs :) because in this tfs I have only a couple of test projects. All checkin are made by TfsAdmin, the user I used to connect to my local TFS but the comment in the checkins are preserved

Surely TFS Integration Platform is a project that evolves a lot, it is constantly maintained and you cannot miss it if you work with TFS.
