I think that [Power Tools](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2010/04/26/tfs-2010-power-tools-have-released.aspx) are indeed a must-have for every person that works with TFS. The new April 2010 version has a couple of commands that are really interesting. They are called AddProjectPortal and AddProjectReports and are used to create project portal and reports for Team Project that currently does not have one.

This commands are useful for those one that starts with Tfs basic, then move to a Full version and for many other scenario.

Alk.
