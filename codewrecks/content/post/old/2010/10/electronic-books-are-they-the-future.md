I know that with electronic version I donâ€™t spend the shipping cost (That for me in Italy are quite high respect citizen in the US) and I got my book almost istantaneously, but it seems to me ridiculous that the electronic version of the book actually costs MORE than the printed version.

Until price of E-Books are so high, they will not replace the paper form in my opinion.

Alk.
