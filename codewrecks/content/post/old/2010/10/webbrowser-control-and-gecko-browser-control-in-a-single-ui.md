I works quite often in last months with WPF programs that need to include a browser control, and the obvious choice is using WebBrowser control. In last days we need to use Gecko Browser, because we like the ability to customize it and to make possible for the user to look at a site with IE rendering or Firefox Rendering.

After some fighting and with the help of my friend Stefano Castriotta we finally manage to have it works ![Smile](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wlEmoticonsmile1.png) now I have a program where you can switch the browser control at real time and with a single click.

Pressing the button we see that the page is reloaded

And I'm able to make the user choose witch browser to use to surf with the program :). It was funny work to manage it to works, but the result is really cool.
