[Lab Management](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lab_management/) is surely one of the most exiting new feature for TFS 2010 and now we finally have a Release Date.

Since Lab Management is really a complex set of tools, even if it is in the iso images of TFS 2010 is still considered to be in â€œrelease candidateâ€ version. Now we can announce two big news

- RTM Bits will be released at the end of August
- Lab managements will be avaliable even in MSDN Ultimate or TestProfessional with MSDN

The second news is very well welcomed, because it widen the number of people that could benefit from Lab Management.

If you want to test lab management you can find a preconfigured VHD ([http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=195885](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=195885 "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=195885"))

There are also [videos](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=195885) that can give you an idea of the product.

You can find more [details here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lab_management/archive/2010/08/04/general-availability-of-visual-studio-lab-management-announced.aspx) about the improvement made in RTM.
