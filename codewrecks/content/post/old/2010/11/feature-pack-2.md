Some days ago the [Feature pack 2](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vstsue/archive/2010/11/16/visual-studio-2010-feature-pack-2-expands-test-capabilities-and-includes-code-visualization-modeling-tools-from-previous-feature-pack.aspx) was released. This pack will extend testing capabilities of VS2010, and one of the coolest addition is a graphical editor for the UIMap of Coded UI test.

Another killer feature is the official support to run coded ui test With Mozilla firefox 3.5 or higher and support for Coded UI testing silverlight 4 applications.

If you are using Coded UI Test you cannot miss it.
