I really believe that such a word (Hackability) does not exists ![Smile](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wlEmoticonsmile.png) but a tweet I saw minutes ago makes me think a little bit, the tweet was this one

* **I hear about WordPress blogs getting hacked HOURLY. What is it about WP that makes it so hacker friendly?** *

The answer is simple IMHO, wordpress is the most used blog engine, so hackers always try to break it, because if you hack wordpress you virtually hack a large amount of blogs, while if you hack other blog platform you will hack a minor number of sites. Iâ€™m not an hacker, but I think that even if a site engine is really hard to break, if it is used by millions of people it worth trying to break it, and since no product is bugfree, surely some flaws will be found. Every program used by millions of people can be hacker friendly ![Smile with tongue out](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/wlEmoticonsmilewithtongueout.png)
