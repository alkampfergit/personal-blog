I'm a very noob Blend user ![Smile](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wlEmoticon-smile1.png) and I learn it without reading or seeing any tutorial, just opened blend and begin to use itâ€¦ this is no good ![Smile](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/wlEmoticon-smile1.png) because I missed some basic features like for example that the grid can be put in Canvas or Grid modeâ€¦.

 ***Figure 1***: *The grid is in canvas mode, the upper left icon is reflecting this, but I did not know of this feature.. so bad*

Now I want to change Column width, but when I move the cursor of the columnâ€¦here is what happens

* ***Figure 2***: Textbox are the same even if I resize the column, blend adds for me margins to make the ui looks the same after column resize.*

I was frustrated to manually change all margins and after one day I discovered that clicking in that upper left icon the grid can be put in Grid Mode, and now resizing columns behave as I expected.

the lesson is, take some online lesson or read a book before use a new tools, because try and learn can really slow down productivity and makes you miss some important functionality :)
