Microsoft releases a Virtual Machine with TFS and VS 2010 with some test data and hands on labs, that are really useful for demo or just to try out the new functionalities.

The machine have a 6 month expiration, and the old version expired today. If you still want to use them you can download the update version [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2010/06/25/now-available-visual-studio-2010-rtm-virtual-machine-with-sample-data-and-hands-on-labs.aspx). This new version has already the Feature pack 2 installed and other updates that are listed in the link above, but if you are curious here is all the updates from the older version.

· Visual Studio 2010 Feature Pack 2     
 · Team Foundation Server 2010 Power Tools (September 2010 Release)      
 · Visual Studio 2010 Productivity Power Tools (these are disabled in VS so that the screenshots of the hands-on-labs still match; you can quickly enable the Productivity Power Tools via Tools -&gt; Extension Manager from within Visual Studio)      
 · Test Scribe for Microsoft Test Manager      
 · Visual Studio Scrum 1.0 Process Template      
 · All Windows Updates through December 8, 2010
