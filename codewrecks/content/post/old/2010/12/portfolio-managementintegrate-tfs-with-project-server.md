Finally the beta of integration between project server and TFS is out, and you can try it. All the detail can be found in the post in [Brian Harry's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2010/12/07/portfolio-management-tfs-lt-gt-project-server-integration-in-beta.aspx). Basically is a tool that manage synchronization between a TFS instance and project server, that permits to managers to work on project server for resource management, while developers still use TFS for agile process management.

If you have project server and tfs in your organization, this is a tool you should not miss.
