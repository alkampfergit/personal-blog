Iâ€™ve the need to use a listview in a WPF project based on touch monitor, and the user needs to scroll element of listview horizontally and vertically, and each element should be a UserControl with a complex ui interface.

I started with a couple of articles, [this one](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/DraggableListView.aspx) that shows a custom ListView based on the original ListView, and [that one](http://blogs.claritycon.com/blogs/kevin_marshall/archive/2007/10/18/3332.aspx) that shows an iPhone like ListView with kinetic movement. None of them satisfy my needs, but I used them as starting point to create my user control that permits me to satisfy the user need.

I implemented some nice features, if you drag partially a control, when you release the mouse the list use a smooth animation to always make the first element fully visible, if a button is in the template of the listview, you can click, but if you drag the element clicking on the button no click is raised.

If you like it, Iâ€™ll make it available on codeplex, let me know.
