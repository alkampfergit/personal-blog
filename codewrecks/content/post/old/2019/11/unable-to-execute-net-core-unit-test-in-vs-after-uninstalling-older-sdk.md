It is not uncommon to have installed many versions of.NET core framework, especially after many Visual Studio updates. **Each installation consumes disk space so I’ve decided to cleanup everything leaving only major version of the framework installed in the system.** Everything worked fine, except Visual Studio Test Explorer that, upon test run request, generates this error in Tests output window

This happens to every.NET core 2.2 test project, if I update framework to netcore3.0 everything went good. After a brief check everything seems ok, but then I realized that  **Visual Studio is a x86 process, so it is probably using x86 version of the.NET Core SDK.** Since I’ve uninstalled every version except x64 major version of every SDK (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0) I’ve actually removed all x86 version (Except 3.0) and this could be the reason.

To verify this supposition, I went to the folder C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App where I can check every version I’ve actually installed for my system. Gotcha, only version 3.0 was present. The final proof was downloading and installing latest x86 version for.NET core 2.2, to verify if it will fix the issue, and, gotcha, VS was able to run Unit tests based on.NET core 2.2 again.
