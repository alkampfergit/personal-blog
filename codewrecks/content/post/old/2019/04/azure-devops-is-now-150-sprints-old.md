I remember old days when Azure DevOps was still in private preview, and yet it was really a good product, **now 150 sprints passed, and the product is better than ever**. Not everything is perfect, but, as users, we can expect new feature to being deployed each 3 weeks, the duration of Microsoft Sprint.

This means that now the product is 450 Weeks old, and finally we got a little nice feature that shows up news in the front page.

This allows users to immediately being notified of new feature in their accounts, with a nice summary with key new features. In this sprint we have the  **new Task Assistant to help editing YAML pipelines** , and many new feature, like the new agent administration ui.

The new page is more consistent with the look and feel of the rest of the service, also it shows wait time and build duration when you drill down in a pool.

As always I cannot stress out how good is to have all of your project administration tool in the Cloud, no time spent to upgrade, no time spent to verify and check backup policies, and, completely free for the first 5 users.
