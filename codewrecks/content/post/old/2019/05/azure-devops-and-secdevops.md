One of the cool aspect of Azure DevOps is the extendibility through marketplace api, and for security you can find a nice marketplace addin called Owasp ZAP ([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kasunkodagoda.owasp-zap-scan](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kasunkodagoda.owasp-zap-scan)) that can be used to automate OWASP test for web application.

You can also check this nice article in MSDN [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/azure-devops-pipelines-leveraging-owasp-zap-in-the-release-pipeline/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/azure-devops-pipelines-leveraging-owasp-zap-in-the-release-pipeline/) that explain how you can leverage OWASP ZAP analysis during a deploy with release pipeline.

REally good stuff to read / use.
