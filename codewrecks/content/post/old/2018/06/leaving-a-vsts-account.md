As a VSTS trainer, it is quite common for me to made students create VSTS Accounts, play with them and being enlisted in those account to help them in various stuff. It happens also that some customer gives me temporary access to the VSTS account, and in all those years, many of them forgot to remove me from the account.

This is annoying because each time Visual Studio or other tools try to understand VSTS accounts I have right to access, the list is really long.  **Luckily enough few months ago, the team added the ability to leave an account directly from your profile list**.

 ***Figure 1***: *Profile page where you can leave all the account you are not interested into.*

So if you, like me, have access to VSTS accounts you do not care of, proceed to cleanup your access list leaving all accounts you are not interested into.
