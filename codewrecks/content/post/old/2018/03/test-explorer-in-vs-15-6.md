The latest version of VS introduces some new cool feature, and it is quite big (almost 1 GB of download). **If I should give you a single reason to upgrade to this new version, is the new Test Runner that now has the ability to show tests hierarchically** [![image](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image_thumb.png "image")](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image.png)

Since I’m a great NUnit fan, I always like the ability to see my tests following the namespace structure of my test projects, this is surely much more better than a flat list. Actually I can detatch test runner from VS IDE and keep it on my second monitory to have a quick look at my test outcome.

The full list of bugfix and improvements can be [found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes).
