This is a long and awaited feature, not because VSTS should fight GitHub as Open Source repository standard, but because an organization is often composed by many private projects and some projects that are public and Open Source.

You can read about the new feature [in this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/04/27/vsts-public-projects-limited-preview/), the feature is in preview, but will become available to every account in the future. Enjoy it.
