I’ve blogged yesterday about the video on channel 9 that explains how to configure a build server against a TfsPreview account and this morning Brian Harry made a [post that explains this process in great detail](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/09/15/configuring-a-build-server-against-your-shiny-new-hosted-tfs-account.aspx).

The good part is that you have a lot of possible configuration.

> You can install the build server on any machine you use – a workgroup machine at home, a domain machine at work, an Azure VM Role, an Amazon VM, whatever you like. TFS doesn’t really care. The machine just has to have connectivity to the internet to get to tfspreview.com

This is good, because usually you have a little work to do using a build controller in workgroup environment or outside a domain, but with TfsPreview everything is really easy and quick to setup.

If you still did not have an invite for TfsPreview, check [the Brian Harry’s post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2011/09/15/more-team-foundation-service-activation-codes.aspx) some more code are available.

Alk.
