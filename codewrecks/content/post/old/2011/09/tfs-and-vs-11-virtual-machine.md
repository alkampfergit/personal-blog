As usual Brian Keller has produced a test VM with all sort of goodness regarding TFS 11 and VS 11, [you can find details here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2011/09/16/visual-studio-11-application-lifecycle-management-virtual-machine-and-hands-on-labs-demo-scripts.aspx). The machine is full of useful staff, as described in Brian Keller’s post:

- Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition
- Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2
- Microsoft Visual Studio 11 Ultimate Developer Preview
- Microsoft Team Foundation Server 11 Developer Preview
- Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010
- Microsoft Project 2010
- Microsoft Office Professional 2010 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel)
- Sample users and data required to support hands-on-lab scripts which accompany this download and exercise some of the new Visual Studio 11 application lifecycle management capabilities introduced in this release

The only drawback is that it is only an Hyper-V machine, no more Virtual PC version, this is mainly due to the need to have a 64 bit machine (that is currently unsupported in virtual pc).
