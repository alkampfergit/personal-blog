I’m installing TFS 11 developer preview and I got this.

So I clicked settings, added another 4 gb ram to the machine (to a total of 6 GB), vmWare workstation suspend the machine for a bunch of seconds, then I rerun check and magically I can move on.

And I’m a few seconds away to have a TFS 11 to play with dev11 bits :), I’m exited.
