Today at Tech Ed Usa [some of the news](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/archive/2011/05/16/announcing-alm-roadmap-in-visual-studio-vnext-at-teched.aspx) about Visual Studio vNext [were revealed](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/roadmap?sf1468488=1), I do not want to give you detailed information in my blog, because there are a lot of resources around there and especially you can download a [nice pdf with all the public news](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9772730).

One of my favorite is the new dashboard, a rich web application that permits the organization and prioritization of the backlog with few clicks, and permits to plan a sprint entirely in a web application, with a rich client experience. Finally we have a good web based *Task Board* where we can update visually the status of work items.

But without any doubt, my favorite new feature is the new * **Test Runner** *. Finally Visual Studio will have a real cool test runner, that permits to run test in the background while Iâ€™m working on code, that has also a better support of the â€œreg-green-refactorâ€ way of developing code. Another really cool feature is an integrated *code review* support, fully integrated in Visual Studio as well as a *Code Clone Detection* tool, that will help you find duplicate code that needs to be refactored.

Connection with TFS through Team Explorer is now fully asynchronous, that will improve a lot the overall experience and access time.

Now we need a public beta to play with the bit :P
