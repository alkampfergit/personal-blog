One of the cool feature of TFS2010 is the separation between *installation*and *configuration.*If you need to install a fresh TFS2010 now that SP1 is out, you can simply install tfs, skip the configuration phase and immediately install SP1. This will install SP1 bits on the machine, now you can proceed to configuration.

After everything is done you can verify that the server is really running with SP1 enabled.

As you can see, after configuration the Version tells me that Iâ€™m running with SP1 installed ![Smile](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png)
