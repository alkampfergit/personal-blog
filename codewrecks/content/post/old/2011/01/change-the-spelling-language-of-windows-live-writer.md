I used to blog in English, but sometimes I wrote something for my Italian Blog. I got disappointed by the fact that Windows Live Writer permits me to use only English spelling language, because I've installed the english version of Live Tools.

Then I read in the internet that language dictionary files used by WLW are the same of office, so I go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\PROOF and look for any file that suggest me of Italian dictionaries.[![image](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb20.png "image")](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image20.png)

Luckily enough, it was really simple to locate the only two files that end with IT. Now I go to installation directory of WLW and I found a directory called Dictionary

C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Live\Writer\Dictionaries

Wow, it contains the very same kind of files,.dll and.lex so I copied the two IT files from office directory to Dictionaries directory of WLW andâ€¦

It seems that Italian language is now available. I do not know why WLW has not an easier way to install a new language dictionary ![Smile](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-smile1.png) but at least it works if you have Office 2010 installed ![Smile with tongue out](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png)
