I used my [kineticlistview](http://kineticlistview.codeplex.com/) in one project, and I noticed that it has a nasty white border around the content, but when I change back the control to standard ListView I noticed that the border remains.

This means that this is standard behavior of the ListView, but it is inacceptable on this project where I use the ListView to show pictures.

Now you can simply go to blend, right click the ListView and choose to edit the template

Now I simply give a name to this new template and store them into a resource file

This will make my new template available everywhere in the project. Here is the default template of the ListView

[![SNAGHTML20379ac](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/SNAGHTML20379ac_thumb.png "SNAGHTML20379ac")](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/SNAGHTML20379ac.png)

Just set all paddings to zero and the game is done. Now that you have this new template in a resource file you can apply directly to every ListView of the project simply with a right click on the ListView in Blend.

Now run the program again and... voilÃ  ![Smile](https://www.codewrecks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png) the nasty one pixel white border is gone.
