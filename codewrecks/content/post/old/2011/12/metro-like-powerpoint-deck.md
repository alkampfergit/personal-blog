I’ve just uploaded to SlideShare a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/alkampfer/unit-testing-10611545) created with Metro Interface in mind. It is a draft on a presentation for a course on Unit Testing and I wanted to spend some time to design it to resemble a Metro interface, because I liked it really much :).

Feel free to give me any comments/suggestion/critics on the appearance of the slide, and feel free to use it as a base for your presentation if you liked the appearance.

Gian Maria.
