[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Mix11VideosDownloadThemAllWithRSS.aspx) published a post explaining how to download MIX11 videos from the RSS, and there are a lot of comments that explain how to use a script to have an automatic download.

To download all of them, simply install [Free Download Manager](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/). When fdm is installed, navigate on one of the rss page in IE, as an example the High Res WMV ([http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/RSS/wmvhigh](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/RSS/wmvhigh)), then Right-click and select *Download all with Free Download Manager*.

Now simply filter to download all file with wmv extension

Choose a destination folder and the game is done. FDM takes care of retry, issue multiple request for the same file if resume is supported, managing bandwidth etc etc.
