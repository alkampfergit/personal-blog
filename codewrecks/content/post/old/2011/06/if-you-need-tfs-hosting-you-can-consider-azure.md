Yes, as Brian Harry announced some months ago, TFS on Azure will be a reality, actually there is a [platform preview](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/team-foundation-server-on-windows-azure-preview) here, but it is actually closed, so you need to wait to have your TFS on Azure, but if you are planning to move on TFS and youâ€™d like to use an hosted version of TFS this could be really a good option.

If you could not wait to have your hosted TFS server, [this is another useful link](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/team-foundation-server/hosting) that contains various offers made by different companies.

Alk.
