Yes, as Brian Harry announced some months ago, TFS on Azure will be a reality, actually there is a [platform preview](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/team-foundation-server-on-windows-azure-preview) here, but it is actually closed, so you need to wait to have your TFS on Azure, but if you are planning to move on TFS and you'd like to use an hosted version of TFS this could be really a good option.

If you could not wait to have your hosted TFS server, [this is another useful link](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/team-foundation-server/hosting) that contains various offers made by different companies.

Alk.
