TFS is not a tool, but a *platform/ecosystem* and if you miss to install / consider to use all of the free or commercial tools based on Tfs, you are actually missing the most part of it. Surely TFS comes with a very huge amount of features out of the box, but there are also an extremely high number of useful tools developed by third party developers.

Here is a *surely incomplete list* (I'll try to keep it updated) and in random order of a bunch of tools I know for TFS ecosystem.
