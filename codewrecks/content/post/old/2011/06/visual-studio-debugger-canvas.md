Debugger Canvas is [now released](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/debuggercanvas), it promises to be an useful addin for VS 2010 Ultimate to easy debugging process for big projects. The site has an introductory video that shows all major feature of this tool. First impression is really good, especially for the integration with the Intellitrace log, so I strongly suggest you to install it if you use the Ultimate version of Visual Studio.
