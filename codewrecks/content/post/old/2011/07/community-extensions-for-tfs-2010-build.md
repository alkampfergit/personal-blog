I'm happy to announce that on 4 of July 2010 the community [TFS Build extensions](http://tfsbuildextensions.codeplex.com/) project on codeplex published its [first stable release](http://tfsbuildextensions.codeplex.com/releases/view/67138).

TFS 2010 build system is based on Workflow Foundation and this means that you can extend writing custom activities (I blogged [quite a lot](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/tag/tfs-build/) about TFS Build in the past) or using legacy MSBuild actions. With this release you have now 100 new Actions / Activities you can use in your builds as well as a big amount of source code to understand how you can write extensions for Tfs Build System.

I strongly suggest you to have a look at it.

Alk.
