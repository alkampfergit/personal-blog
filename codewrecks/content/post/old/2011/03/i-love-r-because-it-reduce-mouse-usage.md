I have this piece of code

And doc2 is checked because it could be null, so I can ALT+RET and choose the right action, as example check if doc2 is null

And I got this

With a couple of click on the keyboard, if you to not like all of the code to be indented inside the if you can press ALT+RETURN on the declaration of the doc2 variable

Resharper add an if and the caret is positioned on the default action, that is throw NotImplementedException, so you can just type return; and the game is done

Such operations are so common when you write code, that the ability to issue such check without leaving your finger from the keyboard is invaluable.
