 ***Figure 1***: *Team Project rename suggestion on User Voice*

Today, Brian Harry announced [new Visual Studio Online Update](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2015/04/13/vs-online-update-april-10th.aspx) and it contains this feature, even if it will not be available to everyone at the beginning.  **For those people that uses TFS on-premise you will have this feature in the upcoming new version: TFS 2015**.

I strongly suggests you to have a look at [Visual Studio User Voice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio) and give your suggestion, because it is in the radar of Visual Studio Team.

Gian Maria.
