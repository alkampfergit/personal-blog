I’m working on a new blog theme, but I’m surely not a good designer :), but thanks to metro design it is quite simple to create a readable style for the site.

Here is a screenshot of the work in process.

I think that it will improve the readability of the blog, at least I hope :).

Have a great weekend.

Alk.
