If you work with Sql Server and like [Red-Gate](http://www.red-gate.com) tools, you can find a couple of interesting webinars to see some features of their exceptional tools in action. If you are interested you can find [all the details here](http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/webinars); webinars are free and require only a registration, so go and take a look at what Red Gate can offer :).
