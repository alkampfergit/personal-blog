Yesterday **the Release Candidate of TFS2012 and Visual Studio 2012 were released by the Visual Studio team** , you can download directly from Microsoft, and yes, the name is now officially Visual Studio 2012 and TFS 2012 :)

 **Visual Studio 2012 RC** : [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us)

 **Team Foundation Server 2012 RC** : [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29918](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29918 "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29918")

If you are interested in the changes from the Beta you can [check this MSDN Page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386063%28v=vs.110%29), you can find also a lot of information from the Visual Studio ALM Rangers, that [released the Readiness RC Wave](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2012/05/31/welcome-to-visual-studio-2012-alm-rangers-readiness-rc-wave.aspx) full of important information. We have a good improvement on the upgrade process as [described in This post,](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2012/05/31/deep-dive-on-configure-features.aspx) that explains the new upgrade procedure and how the wizard can avoid breaking something if you have customized a standard TFS Process.

 **You have also a brand new Developer Tools Blog at this url** : [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/developer-tools/](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/developer-tools/ "http://blogs.msdn.com/b/developer-tools/")

Happy Programming.
