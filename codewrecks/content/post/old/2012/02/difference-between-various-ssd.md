Some time ago I [posted some benchmark of my SSD](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2011/09/23/extract-the-maximum-from-your-hardware/), this is the result I got from my Intel X25-M

It is a really good result compared to a standard disk, expecially in the 4K and 4K QD32, now I bought a Vertex 3 SSD 240 GB and first of all I run again diskmark to see if it is really faster respect my old Intel X25-M, and result are awesome.

The amazing data is on 4K write and 4K QD32 write, where it completely outperform my old Intel X25-M. For a price of 270€ vat included, I think that this drive is a MustHave.
