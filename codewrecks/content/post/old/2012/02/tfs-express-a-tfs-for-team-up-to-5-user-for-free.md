As you can read [from Brian Harry’s blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/02/23/coming-soon-tfs-express.aspx)

> In TFS 11, we are introducing a new download of TFS, called Team Foundation Server Express, that includes core developer features:
> 
> - Source Code Control
> - Work Item Tracking
> - Build Automation
> - Agile Taskboard
> - and more…
> 
> 
> The best news is that it’s  **FREE** for individuals and teams of up to 5 users.

This is really a BIG NEWS expecially for the really super-easy installing and configuring, because we can read in Brian’s post

> When we release our TFS 11 Beta here shortly, I’ll post a download link to the TFS Express installer. Installing it is a snap. No more downloading and mounting an ISO image. You can install TFS Express by just clicking the link, running the web installer and you’re up and running in no time.

The ability to just click a link and having a TFS Basic for FREE for team up to 5 users is really an awesome news. But the news does not ends here, because Brian announces a TFS integration in the Express product. This means that you can start to work with TFS + VS Express for FREE :)

Happy TFS.
