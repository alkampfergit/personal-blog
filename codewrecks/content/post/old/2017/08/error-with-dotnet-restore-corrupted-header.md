I’m trying to compile with dotnetcore 2.0 a project on Linux, but I got this strange error when I run the dotnet restore command.

 ***Figure 1***: *Error restoring packages*

The exact error comes from NuGet.targets and tells me:  **a local file header is corrupt** and points to my solution file. Clearly this project builds just fine on another computer.

Since I’m experiencing intermittent connection, I suspect that nuget cache can be somewhat corrupted, so I run this command to clear all caches.

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}


dotnet nuget locals --clear all

{{< / highlight >}}

 **This clear all the caches. After this command run, I simply re-run again the dotnet restore command and this time everything went well.** Gian Maria.
