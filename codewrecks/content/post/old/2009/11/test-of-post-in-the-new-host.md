As you can see I've changed the host and domain name of this blog. It was somewhat forced by old hosting, because suddenly, permalinks stopped working on our site.

I have two way, the first is trying to solve the problem, the second one is moving the blog to another host. I and Guardian tried to solve the problem, but it was impossible, so I decided to move away from the host, but since I do not want to force all other Guys of Nablasoft to move on, I decided to move onto another completely different domain by my own.

The name of the site was suggested by my dear friend Marco Melli, here is the meaning of Wreck in my dictionary.

 **Wrek:** Ship that has sunk or that has been very badly damaged.

This terms is really strange to be used for a blog, but I liked very much. After all, most of my blog entries, contain snippet of code, that are like wrecks of code in the sea of Internet. Except the change in name, my blog will continue to have the same content as usual. I want to thanks all the people that spent time in reading it, and I hope that you like the new name.

Good day to everyone.

Alk.
