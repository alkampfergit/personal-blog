Today all of our blogs stopped working, it seems that permalink does not works anymore, it is a problem that occurred today, and our host service does not know why. I'm convinced that to host seriously something, you need to have full control on the machine where the webserver lives.

Sorry for all you guy, but until we will not found a solution (the only one I see is change hosting), all of the links to our nablasoft blogs are broken :( it is so sad :( :(

Alk.
