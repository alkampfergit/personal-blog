Today all of our blogs stopped working, it seems that permalink does not works anymore, it is a problem that occurred today, and our host service does not know why. Iâ€™m convinced that to host seriously something, you need to have full control on the machine where the webserver lives.

Sorry for all you guy, but until we will not found a solution (the only one I see is change hosting), all of the links to our nablasoft blogs are broken :( it is so sad :( :(

Alk.
