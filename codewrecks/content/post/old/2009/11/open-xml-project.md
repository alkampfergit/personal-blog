Iâ€™ve received some comments in an old [post](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2008/08/29/openxml-office-format-open-and-substitute-text/), regarding the manipulation of docx documents, with the purpose of substitute parts of the original document with [images](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2008/09/08/manage-image-in-openxml-format-part2/) or pieces of text. Iâ€™ve blogged also how to use [Excel](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2008/11/28/create-a-report-in-excel-2007-with-open-xml-sdk-10/) to create reports, and populate data programmatically with OpenXml standard.

The original code was developed for an Italian company named [ActValue](http://www.actvalue.com) I collaborate with, and some people asked me to publish the full code. I cannot publish the exact version of the current library, but, thanks to the courtesy of [ActValue](http://www.actvalue.com), I can now publish an old version of the code, that contains all the techniques Iâ€™ve described in my old post about [OpenXml](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/?s=openxml) Format.

Please use the code only as a reference to better understand the technique I explained in my blog, this is not fully ready production code. You can do everything you want with it, this is the disclaimer.
