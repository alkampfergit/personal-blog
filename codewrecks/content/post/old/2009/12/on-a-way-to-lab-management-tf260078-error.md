I'm configuring Lab Management in the virtual machine with the test contrller and TFS, but when it ask me for credentials to connect to System Center Virtual Machine Manager, I specify the credentials of Domain Admin and it gives me this error.

It is strange, because administrator is the user I currently use to manage SCVMM, but maybe there is some restrictions to be used by the Lab management agent, so I decided to create a specific user in active directory called Labmanagement, and then goes to the administration tab of SCVMM and added to the admin role

Now I return to the lab management configuration and everything works as expected.

alk.
