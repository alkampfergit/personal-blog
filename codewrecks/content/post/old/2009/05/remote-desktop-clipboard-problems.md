Today I have a server used in remote desktop where clipboard stops to transfer to my machine. Usually the clipboard data of the server is transferred to my machine, but this afternoon it stops working. The server cannot be restarted, I tried to logoff my user from the machine, then enter again with RDP..nothing. To transfer large text data to my dev machine now I'm forced to use a shared fileâ€¦.here is my new powerclipboard
