Iâ€™ve quite always used Nunit for unit testing, I had some little project with mbUnit and a try with xUnit, but I feel comfortable with Nunit so I never had the need to switch to other environment. Now I wanna take a shot to msTest, mainly because it is fully integrated with visual studio and it has some interesting option.

Iâ€™ll try as much as possible to point out the differences between them in future posts.

Alk.
