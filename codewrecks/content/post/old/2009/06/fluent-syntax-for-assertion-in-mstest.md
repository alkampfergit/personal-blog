Switching from [Nunit](http://www.nunit.org) to [MsTest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSTest) is quite simple, but the first thing I really miss with mstest was the lack of a fluent assertion syntax. Consider the assertion you must write if you want to check that a number is lesser than 100 or greater than 200

{{< highlight xml "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
[TestMethod]
public void BaseAssertFluentWithSyntaxHelperLtOrGtRo()
{
    Int32 obj = 400;
    Assert.IsTrue(obj < 100 || obj > 200);
}{{< / highlight >}}

It is quite clear, but with fluent syntax you can write test like this

{{< highlight csharp "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
[TestMethod]
public void BaseAssertFluentWithSyntaxHelperLtOrGtR()
{
    Int32 obj = 400;
    FluentAssert.That(obj, Is.LesserThan(100).Or.GreaterThan(200));
}{{< / highlight >}}

I find it really clearer than the first form. The advantage of a fluent syntax is that you can read the assertion as if were English text. Iâ€™m actually writing an helper assembly to support fluent syntax with msTest, if someone is interested in I can publish in source form. For now Iâ€™m able to support basic syntax with operator precedence and parenthesis

{{< highlight csharp "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
[TestMethod]
public void TestBasic2()
{
    IConstraint c = Is.LesserThan(100) | Is.GreaterThan(200) & Is.GreaterThan(300);
    Assert.IsTrue(c.Validate(99));
}

[TestMethod]
public void TestBasicParenthesis()
{
    IConstraint c = (Is.LesserThan(100) | Is.GreaterThan(200)) & Is.GreaterThan(300);
    Assert.IsFalse(c.Validate(99));
}{{< / highlight >}}

As you can see the first test pass because the And operator ( expressed by & because you cannot overload &&) has higher precedence over the or operator. The second test pass because you can alter precedence with parenthesis.
