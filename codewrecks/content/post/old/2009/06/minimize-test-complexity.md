I have a function that does these steps

1) it accepts a string parameter let it call P     
2) Manipulate that parameter P, transforming in P1 with an algorithm that is contained in a specific class      
3) uses P1 it to ask for database instance of some classes and does a lot of manipulations and database operations

Now I want only to test that the class calls the algorithm to transform P in P1. All other functions of that sut are already verified, I first begun with a skeleton test I used previously to test the sut, this skeleton makes heavy use of Mocks and stubs objects to FULLY simulate the database.

In the end I have a test that works, but it was too complex, mainly because it is full of stub expectation. Moreover it is Fragile, because if I'll change the way how this test interact with the DB, I'll need also to change expectations. So I changed the test in this way.

        //Ignore everything.

    pd.AssertWasCalled(obj => obj.TransformParam(Arg<String>.Is.Equal("MyParameter"));

MySut is the class I need to test, it internally calls IoC.Resolve&lt;IParamTransformer&gt;(), to take a parameter transformer. Thanks to [AAA syntax of Rhino Mocks](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/05/16/Rhino-Mocks--Arrange-Act-Assert-Syntax.aspx) I simply create a mock, use an internal override function to instruct the IoC component to return my mock when asked to resolve a IParamTransformer, then invoke sut method. Since I know that the test calls the DAL with transformed parameter I simply ask in the test to catch every DbException, ignore it and then assert that the TransformParam is called. The test is quick because I used SqlLite to have a Db in memory, the sut resolve the IParamTransformer, calls for parameter transformation, then calls the db; the db call failed because the test db is empty so a DbException is thrown. Now the exception is ignored and I finally verify that function TransformParam was called.

This test is less than half length respect to the first version that fully mimics the DAL with mock objects. I think that it is really clearer, because it is focused on â€œwhat I want to testâ€ without distracting the reader with greedy details.

A still better solution could be a refactoring of the original class, making it more testable, but I think that this is enough.
