Iâ€™m installing Tfs 2008 on a Virtual machine. Following the guide I saw that I need first to install Share Point Services 3.0 SP2 before installing team foundation server. You can find those part in the [guide](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=FF12844F-398C-4FE9-8B0D-9E84181D9923&amp;displaylang=en) with the title â€œHow to: Install SharePoint Products and Technologies on Windows Serverâ€.

I followed all the instruction, but when team foundation server installer asked me the address of sharepoint site I tried some url but I got the infamous error

> the specified windows sharepoint services site url is not the default site collection site

The missing part in the guide is that after step 19 you need to create a site collection. First of all verify that you are able to browse the root site you have created in step 18

Ok now verify that you can browse the site collection at site [http://tfsalkampfer/sites/base/default.aspx](http://tfsalkampfer/sites/base/default.aspx "http://tfsalkampfer/sites/base/default.aspx") where tfsalkampfer is the name of the machine, probably you get a 404 error, so goes to the administration pane of sharepoint services

You need to click â€œapplication managementâ€ and then â€œCreate site collectionâ€. Now you should see the page to create another site collection

Please be sure that you are working on the Web application you have created for Tfs, then simply use the /sites/ option in the combo and specify whathever name you want for the web site address, iâ€™ve chosen â€œBaseâ€. Now press ok and verify that the site collection is ok browsing [http://tfsalkampfer/sites/base/default.aspx](http://tfsalkampfer/sites/base/default.aspx "http://tfsalkampfer/sites/base/default.aspx"), now you can set the value [http://tfsalkampfer/sites/](http://tfsalkampfer/sites/) as share point site during Tfs installation, and now everything went ok.

alk.
