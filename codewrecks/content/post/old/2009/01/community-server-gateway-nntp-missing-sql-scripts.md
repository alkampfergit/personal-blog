I’m configuring a Community Server 2008 with the NNTP gateway, in the instructions you are asked to install some sql scripts that are missing, and when you try to access to the forums with nntp  you gets exception like could not find stored procedure xxx

The reason is explained [here](http://dev.communityserver.com/forums/p/505339/642813.aspx#642813), in the latest distribution the scripts are missing, you can also file link to the scripts in the post.

If someone is stuck with this missing scripts this link can really save your life :P

alk.
