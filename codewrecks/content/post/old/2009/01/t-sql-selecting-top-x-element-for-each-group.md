Today I need to build a query that selects the most expensive three orders made in a date range for each customer. This is the typical query where the ROW\_NUMBER() function introduced with Sql Server 2005 can really helps you. Here is a solution in northwind database.

{{< highlight sql "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
select 
    orderId, 
    CustomerId, 
    Freight from
    (
    select 
        ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by CustomerId order by Freight desc) as RowNumber,
        orderId, 
    CustomerId, 
    Freight
    from 
        orders
    ) as innerTable
where RowNumber < 4
order by CustomerId, Freight desc{{< / highlight >}}

the ROW\_NUMBER creates a column with an incremental number over some order clause and optionally partitioned over some columns. In this example I partition by CustomerId, this means that for each CustomerId the RowNumber starts again with number 1 then I order for â€œFreight descâ€. I put everything in an inner Select and from the outer query I select only the rows whose RowNumber is less than 4, the result is the list of the three order with higher Freight for each customer, really simple ;)
