I Know that Sql SErver 2008 have a lot of new feature in Database Engine, but one of the most loved feature is intellisense in Management Studio. Intellisense really helps you to improve productivity when you write T-Sql code, and it is great to have it included in base version of the MS. The disappointing stuff is that [it does not work when you connect to a sql server 2005 instance](http://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=341872). In my opinion this is bad, but MS have its reason to do so.

In the meanwhile you can still buy a license for [SQL prompt](http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Prompt/index.htm?gclid=CLGaw4C6kJgCFdaU3wodFHnTmw) and use intellisense even in your Sql server 2005 management studio :P

alk.
