I’ve bought a second SATA 10.000 RPM disk, along with an adaptec raid controller to move toward a RAID 1 array. The RAID1 array have more performance in reading, along as increase security because the data are mirrored on two disks. It was a long time (about 1 year) that I did not open a single pc to play with hardware, it is a thing that I like very much, but my actual case is a middle tower (I always Had big Tower case) and putting three disks into it was not a breeze.

As you can see the entropy of the case is really high. First of all, this was my first computer without floppy, but to install windows XP I need to have driver for RAID controller in a Floppy, so I take an old floppy and connected into the board…but..damn asus, the floppy connector is really far from the standard location of the floppy and I need to remove the RAID adapter to plug in the connector. Moreover the controller have two very long sata cable, too long for me :) and to make things more complicated, each of the three disk has a dedicated cooler with two fans…the result is really a mess of cables.

now I turn everything on to see if works, and yes, it is all ok and I begun to create the RAID 1 array.

Now I’m writing this post on the laptop, waiting the RAID array to finishing initialization, then I’ll proceed to a complete reinstall of OS and all the tools I normally use…uff….hope everything will be ok. Finally I need to reduce entropy of the cables triying to put some order into my case :D

alk.
