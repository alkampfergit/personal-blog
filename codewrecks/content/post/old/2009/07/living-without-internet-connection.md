In the last 6 days I lived without an internet connection at home, I felt really strange, no way to contact your friends with skype or msn, no way to read mail, consult some site, buy something on amazonâ€¦I really realized that my life is tightly bounded to internet world :D. I wonder how can we live 10 years ago, when internet connection was done with 33kbps modem :) time changesâ€¦.
