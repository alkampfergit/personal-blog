In the last 6 days I lived without an internet connection at home, I felt really strange, no way to contact your friends with skype or msn, no way to read mail, consult some site, buy something on amazon...I really realized that my life is tightly bounded to internet world :D. I wonder how can we live 10 years ago, when internet connection was done with 33kbps modem :) time changes...

Alk.
