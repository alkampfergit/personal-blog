Teamfuze ([http://www.teamfuze.net/index.jspa](http://www.teamfuze.net/index.jspa)) is gone beta, finally Oracle developers with Visual Studio 2010 Database Edition beta will experience the same feeling of Sql Server developers, when moving from old-style database development to VS Database Edition. You can sync database, put every object in source control system, generate test data, automate database sync during team build and more.

If you develope with oracle you really have to try the beta ;) you will never want to come back :D

Alk.
