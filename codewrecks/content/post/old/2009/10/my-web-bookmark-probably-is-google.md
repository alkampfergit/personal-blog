This morning I need to install a Windows Server on a VHD and boot from VHD, I do not remember all the steps needed to achieve this, so I know that Iâ€™ve previously bookmarked a page from Scott Hanselmanâ€™s blog that have all links and all information to solve my problem

I remember that I bookmarked it, probably in delicious, but I have chrome open, and I have no addin that permits me to search delicious, so it is really simpler writing â€œ*Scott hanselman boot from vhd*â€ in the address bar, and the first link is the one I want.

The result is that if you remember a useful article speaking of this and these, even if you bookmarked it somewhere, probably it is faster to issue a query to google, and take the first result. This is especially true if you remember the source of the article and some important keyword. Yesterday I did â€œAyende Nibernate validationâ€ and I immediate find the article I remember I read some time ago.

In the end probably the best bookmark on the web is Google :).

alk.
