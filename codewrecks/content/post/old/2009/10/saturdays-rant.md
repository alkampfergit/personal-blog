I'm not used to ranting...but this morning I'm really hating Adaptec. I need to install Windows Server 2008 R2 on a bootable VHD. I need to access my RAID Disk array from that system, so I go to adaptec site and download the drivers. Drivers are only for board with a bios version higher than my actual bios, so I need to update bios of RAID card.

In the bios page I see with horror that I need to boot by DOS and there is no windows utility. My Motherboard does not even have floppy connector, so I go to a very beautiful page of adaptec with title

How to create a bootable CD to flash RAID controller BIOS using AFU or IFU?

OOhhh this sounds interesting.... but... wait a moment

To create the CD I need a floppy, this sounds absurd to me, if I already have a floppy I really do not need to boot from CD-Rom or USB Stick. I really understand that I can do this procedure from another pc, now it seems that the only solution is taking a floppy and a blank cd-rom and ask to a friend of mine to create a bootable CD-ROM.

alk.
