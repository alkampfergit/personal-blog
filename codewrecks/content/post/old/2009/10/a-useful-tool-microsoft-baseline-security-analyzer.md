MBSA is a great tool, today I'm configuring a new production server, after I configure everything I simply run it and immediately it found some issues

What I love of MBSA is that he immediately tells you how to solve the specific problem, in this situation I've installed a redistributable component, and mbsa tells me that he needs a critical update, and it points me immediately to the result

It permits to immediately spot security issue with production server, and it is a simple tool to use.

And I want to remember you that a new version 2.1.1 is available for supporting windows 7 and windows server 2008 R2, you can find details [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b1e76bbe-71df-41e8-8b52-c871d012ba78&amp;displaylang=en).

alk.
