You can find some good news [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/vstsdb/archive/2009/10/19/what-s-new-for-data-dude-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx) for Data Dude project system. The most important one is that with VS2010 you will have database project support even with professional edition. You miss some of the advanced features, but you are able to build and deploy database project, and this is really good.

Another point of interest is that Data Dude is installed with TFS build agent, so you do not need to devote one license to the machine where the build agent runs, and this is great.

Alk.
