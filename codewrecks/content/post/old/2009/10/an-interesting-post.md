As you can read in [this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2009/10/01/tfs-2010-for-sourcesafe-users.aspx), there are a lot of new stuff around TFS 2010. The good news is that Standard TFS is a TFS so you can have not only version control, as Source safe does, but the Issue tracker and most important the build automation (how can you lived without :) ).

This sounds so good, it promises to bring TFS power to a really amount of teams. Even if the licensing price is not already announced, in that post you can read that * it will be at least as easy and cost effective to get as SourceSafe has been*. This is a really good news for all those people that are interested in moving towards TFS.

Alk.
