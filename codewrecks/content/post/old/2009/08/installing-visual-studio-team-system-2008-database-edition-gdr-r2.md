Today I need to install [VSDB edition GDR](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&amp;displaylang=en) into a older virtual machine, I just fired the installer and got this error.

But I need also to reinstall the SP1 even if it was already installed on that machine. After those operation all went good and the GDR R2 installs perfectly.
