Today I ordered a third [velociraptor disk](http://www.itsdirect.com.au/com_products.php?view=detail&amp;category_id=30&amp;sub_category=31&amp;Product_ID=4902) to replace my old secondary disk that is a 120GB 5 years old disk (an EIDE one). I noticed that to speed up building process, nothing is better than buy faster disk. I plan to use this disk to move windows swap file, asp.net temporary folder and system temp folder as well as a couple of virtual machine that actually are on old disk.

Then Iâ€™m waiting also for some SSD at good price ;).

Alk.
