When you create database test in a [MsTest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSTest) project, usually it configure an initialization method that deploy the database schema before test runs.

{{< highlight chsarp "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
[AssemblyInitialize()]
public static void IntializeAssembly(TestContext ctx)
{
    //Setup the test database based on setting in the
    //configuration file
    DatabaseTestClass.TestService.DeployDatabaseProject();{{< / highlight >}}

If something went wrong during this phase you probably will end with this not so much useful error message: â€œFailed to deploy database project â€¦â€

And if you look at test result you have no more clue on what is actually failing.

To see actual error you need to look at the â€œRun detailsâ€

Now you can see much more useful information on what is really gone wrong.

From this log you can verify that some post build action went wrong. So do not forget to always take a look at â€œrun detailâ€ to have detail on what is the reason of failure of the test.
