I just want to link an interesting script to handle versioning in an Assembly Build created by Brad Foster. It does lots of stuff and it is an interesting example on how to interact with TFS with powershell.

You can find the script [here in GitHub](https://github.com/voice4net/build-scripts/blob/master/ApplyVersionFromSourceControl.ps1).
