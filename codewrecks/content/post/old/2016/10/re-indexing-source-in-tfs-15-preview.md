If you installed TFS “15” preview you should give a try to code search, because it is surely one of the coolest feature introduced in this new release.

If for some reason the indexing went wrong, or code is not indexed, you can try reindexing using some powershell scripts that are described in [this post](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/search/administration#re-index).

Happy TFS.
