Running Sonar Cloud analysis on your open source project is usually a good thing, it is free, it **gives you tons of useful information** and you can automate everything for free with **GitHub Actions**.

I've dealt with this ckind of functinoality before in my blog, today I want just to show how to create a GH action that works in linux, because usually if you **take the original action from SonarCloud site it will use a windows machine for building**.

> If your continous integration scripts needs some external software to be available, the usual solution is using docker.

First of all I disabled the automatic analysis, since my account of Sonar Cloud is connected to my GitHub account, Sonar Cloud is able to perform automatic Analysis. Believe me, automatic analysis is good, but if you have your test suite it is good to run during a sonar analysis to have some nice metrics, like code coverage for example. If you need to have some external service to run integratino tests, you need to do a custom analysis, because the automatic one ill not be able to do anything .

If you need to run a container with docker, you can add it to a special section of your job called services, that contains the services needed to run your build. 

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      sqlserver:
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:latest
        env:
          ACCEPT_EULA: Y
          SA_PASSWORD: PPAssw00rrd
        ports:
          - 1433:1433
{{< /highlight >}}

As you can see, in the jobs sectino you can spÃ¨ecify a section called **services that contains all the services that are needed to run the build.** Then I usually have a build.ps1 or a **single file build** that can be launched to fully build the solution, run test, prepare nuget packages, everything. This helps creating Continuous Integration tools, because you can simply launch the script and letting it doing everything.

For Sonar Coud you can also create a powershell or bash script that includes also the Sonar Cloud analysis, this allows you **to run analysis locally** and you do not need to configure anything in the build. While **having a script that runs everything is conveient, for Sonar Cloud I'm not sure that this is the good approach**. Developers can install the very same engine that Sonar Cloud uses, this will integrate to the IDE so the developer can see the same issue that he/she would have seen in devlopment branch.

> Some kind of analysis are better to be run only in the CI engine, especially to avoid excessive pollution due to task run from all developers.

Luckly enough the Web interface of Sonar Cloud gives you a nice interface that allows you to download a Github action preconfigured, and you just need to modify for your need. In my situation I have some SQL code to run, and to have a predefined set of data to perform the analysis ohn I hse the northwind database.

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
 steps:
      - name: Set up JDK 11
        uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: 1.11
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Shallow clones should be disabled for a better relevancy of analysis

      - name: Setup dotnet 9
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
        with:
          dotnet-version: 9.x

      - name: Download Northwind Script
        run: |
          curl -o instnwnd.sql https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs/instnwnd.sql

      - name: Install SQL Tools
        run: |
          curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
          curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install mssql-tools unixodbc-dev -y

      - name: Initialize Northwind Database
        run: |
          /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost,1433 -U sa -P PPAssw00rrd -Q "CREATE DATABASE Northwind"
          /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost,1433 -U sa -P PPAssw00rrd -d Northwind -i instnwnd.sql

As you can see, after installation of JDK 11 (step created by the wizard of Sonar Cloud) I've added the **installation of DotNet 9 and then some bash scripts to download the configuration file for northwind** and then run them against my Sql Server instance running in the container. Actually the creation of these steps were made by Visual Studio Code Copilot, using Sonnet 3.7, a really nice experience, and they worked on the first try :).

> Copilot is really useful when you need to create GH action, it can save you tons of time.

Once you got the setup you just need to configure everything else. As usual please check all the standard action of GitHub if they have some new version, in this example I needed to updat e the version of the cache actino to versino4, because the original script was using version 2 that is becoming obsolete. Then as you can see I just run my build script with pwsh ./build.ps1 and the game is done.

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
     - name: Cache SonarCloud packages
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~\sonar\cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-sonar
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-sonar
      - name: Install SonarCloud scanners
        run: |
          dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
      - name: Build and analyze
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Needed to get PR information, if any
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
          SQL_SERVER_TEST_CONNECTION: 'Server=localhost,1433;Database=Northwind;User Id=sa;Password=PPAssw00rrd;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True'
        run: |
          dotnet-sonarscanner begin /k:"alkampfergit_SemanticKernel.Orchestration" /o:"alkampfergit-github" /d:sonar.token="${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}" /d:sonar.host.url="https://sonarcloud.io" /d:sonar.cs.vstest.reportsPaths=TestResults/*.trx /d:sonar.cs.opencover.reportsPaths=TestResults/*/coverage.opencover.xml /d:sonar.coverage.exclusions="**Test*.cs"
          pwsh ./build.ps1

      - name: Finalize SonarCloud analysis
        env:
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        if: always()
        run: |
          dotnet-sonarscanner end /d:sonar.token="${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}"

> In the end setting up analysis for your project with Sonar Cloud is just a matter of minutes thanks to GH Action.

To recap

1. Use a linux machine to run your script (.NET core has full linux support)
2. Use Docker to use all needed dependencies for your CI script to run
3. If you need some pre-configured data for databases or configuration, initialize in your script against Docker instance
4. Put all of your build logic inside a single script file, like `build.ps1`

Enjoy monitoring your project.
