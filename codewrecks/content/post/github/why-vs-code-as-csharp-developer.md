If you're a C# developer who has relied on a full Visual Studio IDE for years, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) might look like too small a tool for serious work. In reality **with big solutions you will find full Visual Studio more productive** but Visual Studio Code now has some specific features that makes it more useful especially for small project.

## C# Developer Toolkit

For productive C# development in VS Code you only need a few well-chosen pieces: the .NET SDK and `dotnet` CLI, the official `C#` extension (OmniSharp) for IntelliSense and debugging, a Test Explorer adapter for running unit tests, and a couple of linters/analysers (EditorConfig, Roslyn analyzers or StyleCop) to keep code consistent. These core tools give you a fast edit-build-test loop while keeping your environment simple and reproducible.

The extension **C# Dev Kit** from Microsoft bundles all these tools in a single install, making it easy to get started with C# development in VS Code. The problem is that it **does not rival with all the feature of full Visual Studio IDE** so the real question is:

> Why should a C# developer use VS Code instead of full Visual Studio IDE?

## GitHub Copilot

The experience of GitHub Copilot in VS Code is +*really better that what you got on other IDEs**. Not only I use VS code insiders and I can work with the **pre-release version of Copilot** but the whole experience is more fluid and integrated. 

Clearly you can work with both Visual Studio and VS Code opened in the same folder, you **can just use the tools more useful for the specific task**, (as an example Debugging in Visual Studio is WAY MORE powerful that VS code) so you can benefit of both worlds. 

Forgetting Visual Studio Code will leave you with a limited Copilot experience in other tools, **so it's worth having VS Code around just for that**. Since you use Coipilot for code generation and suggestions, it is normal.
