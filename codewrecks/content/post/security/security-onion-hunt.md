I've done another couple of videos about [Security Onion](https://securityonionsolutions.com/) focusing on how I can use ***The hunt to look for anomalies in network traffic***. As for the previous video I give a disclaimer: I'm not a Security Onion expert, and those video are meant to keep track of my progress and to **help others to familiarize with the tool**.

In first video I start from an alert from [Strelka](https://github.com/target/strelka) and then proceed to **identify possible compromised machine in the network as well as finding external malicious IPs**.

In second video I push my analysis further, doing **some more interesting queries in the Hunt**. The purpose is understanding the basic syntax to query data in The Hunt.

As usually, any comment is welcome, mainly because these are my first video done in English and I know that there are room for lots of improvement.

Happy 2021.
