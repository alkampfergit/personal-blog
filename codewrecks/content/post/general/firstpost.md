I've started blogging in XXX and clearly the choice was WordPress. I must admit that in lots of years of WordPress I always was quite satisfied by the result, lots of plugin, lots of resources on the internet and the ability to post from programs like Windows Live Writer having a WYSIWYG program.

Years passed, and I've started getting a little bit tired of maintaining my WordPress site, especially because I start feeling that it is a little bit overwelming for maintaining a simple blog.

Thanks to my friend [Giulio Vian](http://blog.casavian.eu/) I've discovered Hugo lots of time ago, but I was always reluctant to switch, especially because I do not want to spend time converting my old posts and verify that permalink are still ok after conversion.

Lastly I've decided that I can leave the old blog as is, where it is and restart from scratch with a new blog on the root site. This means that old posts are still accessible at [the usual old address](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog).

Authoring blog post is also more linear with Hugo, just open a simple text editor and you are ready to go. I've also find a nice plugin of Visual Studio Code that allows me to directly paste an image in markdown.

This means that I'm able to switch away from wordpress, and if everyting will be good with Hugo, probably I'll decide to convert my old blog posts and getting rid completely of WordPress.

Gian Maria.
