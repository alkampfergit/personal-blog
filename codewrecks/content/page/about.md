I was probably born an enthusiast programmer and I discovered it when I start playing with my first computer, a commodore Vic20. With the Vic20 I discovered the joy of programming, It were the 80ies, I have 3.5 KB of memory for my programs, and It seemed to me that computers will really change my life.

After the Vic20 I passed through 80×86, 80x486DX, Pentium 150, AMD K6-2 233, Pentium II 450, Athlon XP2100+, ... until now where I have a machine with 64 GB of RAM, and I still remember when I bough my 486DX and I saved money to expand memory from 4 MB to 8MB.

I begin programming in Vic20 BASIC, then BASIC80, then I studied Pascal, Fortran (a little bit), a little bit of prolog and Cobol. When I went to university I began studying C and C++ and began to have great interest in Computer Graphics. You can find some of my works in www.nablasoft.com , but most of them are in Italian (sorry guys ;) ). I programmed Playstation2 with the Linux kit (you can find a tutorial on [nablasoft site](http://www.nablasoft.com)), I was fanatic of Assembly Language. I’m an electronic engineer with specialization in MicroElectronics, so it is natural that I love low level languages but later in my career I started focusing more on management part of a project.

I was a fan of Agile processes, it could be Kanban or Scrum and I really love DevOps culture.

I work as Independent Consultant in Italy, mainly doing consulting gigs in .NET Framework and Visual Studio ALM, I developed both Windows applications and web applications, and I have a great passion for software architecture and anything around it: pattern, ORM, IoC, etc.

I usually had a blog written in Italian language, but it was idle for really too much time to be considered here.
