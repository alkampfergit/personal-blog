My name is Gian Maria and I was born with a huge interest for computers and everything related, basically I'm a geek. I started playing with my first computer, a commodore Vic20 and I discovered that I really like  programming. *I had only 3.5 KB of memory for my programs and It seemed to me that computers will really change my life**.

I begin programming in Vic20 BASIC, then BASIC80, then I studied Pascal, Fortran (a little bit), a little bit of prolog and Cobol. When I went to university I began studying C and C++ and began to have great interest in Computer Graphics. You can find some of my works at [www.nablasoft.com](http://www.nablasoft.com), but most of them are in Italian (sorry guys ;) ). 

I **really liked playing around with Playstation2 and the Linux kit (you can find a tutorial on [nablasoft site](http://www.nablasoft.com))**, I was fanatic of Assembly Language and since I studied electronic engineering with specialization in MicroElectronics, it is natural that I loved low level languages.

It was when I started to work professionally that I started focusing more on management than low level details. I'm a fan of Agile processes, could it be Kanban or Scrum and I really love DevOps culture.

I'm working as Independent Consultant in Italy, doing consulting jobs for companies working with .NET Framework and **everything around Visual Studio ALM (Azure Devops)**, I developed both Windows applications and web applications, and I have a great passion for software architecture and anything around it: pattern, ORM, IoC, etc.

I'm currently [Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies category](https://www.mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/4025635) and member of some Italian User Groups.

I usually had a blog written in Italian language, but it was idle for really too much time to be considered here.
